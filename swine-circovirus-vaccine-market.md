<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Swine Circovirus Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Genetic Engineering Vaccine</li><li>Killed Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The swine circovirus vaccine market primarily comprises two types: genetic engineering vaccines and killed vaccines. Genetic engineering vaccines utilize recombinant DNA technology to create an immune response, offering potentially longer-lasting protection and targeted efficacy against specific viral strains. In contrast, killed vaccines consist of inactivated virus particles that stimulate an immune reaction without causing disease, facilitating easier handling and safety for pig populations. Both types play vital roles in controlling swine circovirus infections and ensuring healthy livestock production.</p></p>
