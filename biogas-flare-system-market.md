<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Flare System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open System</li><li>Enclosed System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biogas flare system market comprises two main types: open systems and enclosed systems. Open systems release biogas directly into the atmosphere, burning it off to reduce odor and greenhouse gas emissions, making them simpler and more cost-effective. In contrast, enclosed systems capture and burn biogas in a controlled environment, resulting in higher combustion efficiency and lower emissions. These systems are often preferred for compliance with stringent environmental regulations and for maximizing energy recovery from waste.</p></p>
