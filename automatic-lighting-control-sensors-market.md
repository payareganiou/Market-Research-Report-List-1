<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Lighting Control Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Photocell Sensors</li><li>Passive Infrared Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic lighting control sensors enhance energy efficiency by adjusting lighting based on occupancy or ambient light conditions. Photocell sensors detect natural light levels, enabling outdoor and indoor lights to automatically turn off during daylight, thereby conserving energy. In contrast, passive infrared (PIR) sensors identify body heat to determine occupancy, activating lights when movement is detected and turning them off after a set period of inactivity. Both technologies contribute to smart building systems and energy savings in residential and commercial settings.</p></p>
